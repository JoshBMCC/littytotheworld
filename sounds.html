	<b>The sounds of the planet Beautiful are peaceful sounds. Etheral tones breeze through the wind. Birds chirp. Children giggle. Adults laughing. All these sounds can be heard when wandering around the planet. No matter where you are there you hear whatever will bring peace to you in that moment. It's what's so beautiful about Beautiful. Beauty is more than what meets the eyes.</b>
